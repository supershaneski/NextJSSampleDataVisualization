# Data Visualization App using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)

This project is an exercise in my study of ReactJS.<br>
This is my first attempt to make a data visualization application.

## Description

Please note that **the data are just dummy**.<br>
It is based from COVID-19 outbreak data.<br><br>

* The data are read from csv files using [d3-fetch](https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch) module.

* Bar and Line charts use [victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/) module.

* The map visualization is using [react-simple-maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) module.

* The map and table charts use the same data while the bar and line charts uses also the same data.
